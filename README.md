# HauntedHouse
From my Programming 1 class in 2015, a program I collaborated with another student.

The program functions through a dialog box with the main areas being the dining room, living room, and the upstairs.

Whichever area is picked, there are objects that the user interacts with. From there, you have a chance to get a scenario and continue on, you lose, or go back out.
